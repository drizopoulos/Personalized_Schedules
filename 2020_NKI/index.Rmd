# Background & Motivation

## Prostate Cancer (PC)

- PC is the 2nd most frequently diagnosed cancer in males worldwide
    + the most frequent in economically developed countries
    
<br/>

- Many countries run population screening programs using PSA blood tests
    + to identify men who have developed the disease
    + or men who have high risk of developing it
    
<br/>

- <font color = "red">However, these programs have resulted to high rates of 
over-diagnosis and overtreatment</font>
    + standard treatments have serious side-effects

## Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance
- To avoid over-treatment, men with low grade prostate cancer are advised active surveillance

<br/>

- <span style="color:red">Cancer progression</span> is tracked via:
    - Prostate-specific antigen measurements
    - Digital rectal examination
    - <span style="color:red">Biopsies</span>

<br/>

- Treatment is advised when cancer progression is observed
    - typically via biopsies
